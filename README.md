# Open AI Endpoint Tutorial

This repository provides a simple, yet useful introduction to interacting with the Open AI endpoint and performing fundamental tasks. These tasks include sending a text and getting a response, or performing more elaborate tasks using the concept of context or "pre-prompt". This means that a task is executed by sending a context (instructions or examples about how to do it) and the proper text upon which we expect an action (for example: classify a text, extract relevant data from a text, etc.).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple and easy-to-follow guide for those who are new to the Open AI endpoint and may be overwhelmed by more complex repositories and projects. With this tutorial, you will be able to perform fundamental tasks and understand the concept of context and pre-prompting.

## How to Use

To get started with this tutorial, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README file. The instructions will guide you through the process of interacting with the Open AI endpoint and performing fundamental tasks.
